//     gateway, directory, etc.) and its particular type within that category
//     (IM server, phone vs. handheld client, MSN gateway vs. AIM gateway, user
//     directory vs. chatroom directory, etc.). This information helps
//     requesting entities to determine the group or "bucket" of services into
//     which the entity is most appropriately placed (e.g., perhaps the entity
//     is shown in a GUI with an appropriate icon).
